modern, performant, and easy-to-use CTF platform.

## LICENSING
All source-code, including but not limited to the original JavaScript and (S)CSS, are covered under the terms enumerated by the `LICENSE` final. 

We are typically happy to grant exceptions. Please contact `admins@riceteacatpanda.wtf` to request possible terms of use that may not be covered by the license. The only exceptions to the terms of `LICENSE` will be those which are explicitly given by two or more people from both the Sinensis frontend team and RiceTeaCatPanda.
